# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

Welcome to the Telecom Customer Churn Analysis repository! In this repository, you will find resources and code related to analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry using various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Contents

1. **Dataset Used**: The dataset used for this analysis is present in `telecom_churn.csv`. It contains relevant information about telecom customers, including features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and whether they churned or not.

2. **Power BI Dashboard**: Explore the insights derived from the data through interactive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to visualize key metrics and trends related to customer churn.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebook**: Dive into the exploratory data analysis process conducted on the dataset using Jupyter Notebook. The notebook,`EDA.ipynb` contains detailed code and visualizations showcasing various aspects of the dataset and its characteristics.

4. **Machine Learning Models**: Implementations of machine learning models for predicting customer churn can be found in the `model_training.ipynb`. We have employed both logistic regression and random forest models to predict customer churn based on historical data. The model are then stored in `LogisticRegression.pkl` and `RandomForest

## Getting Started

To get started with the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the dataset located in the `telecom_churn.csv` directory.
3. Review the EDA conducted in the Jupyter Notebook (`EDA.ipynb`) to understand the characteristics of the data.
4. Dive into the machine learning models provided in the `model_training.ipynb` directory to understand how customer churn prediction is performed using logistic regression and random forest algorithms.
5. Check out the Power BI dashboard (`telecom customer churn analysis.pbix`) to visualize key insights derived from the data.
6. Experiment with the code and models to adapt them to your specific use case or dataset.
